CSS Sprites
	1. Get the sprites image
	2. See if you can use Sprite Cow to identify the position of the image (just copy and paste the css)
	3. If it cannot identify the image, then use photoshop/gimp to clean it up (make background look different color from icons so Sprite Cow can identify)
	4. Use sprite cow again
	5. The css of sprite cow should include background image, 
		Example
			.fb {
			  background: url(/assets/smi.png) no-repeat -12px -7px;
			  width: 64px;
			  height: 64px;
			  display: inline-block;
			}
	6. The reason why we have inline-block is because sometimes elements like <span> are inline by default which make height and width not work.
